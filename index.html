                        <p>
                            Graph plays a significant role in representing and analyzing complex 
                            relationships in real-world applications such as citation networks, social 
                            networks, and biological data. Graph intelligence is rapidly becoming a 
                            crucial aspect of understanding and exploiting the intricate interconnections 
                            within graph data. Recently, <b>large language models</b> (LLMs) and <b>prompt learning</b> 
                            techniques have pushed graph intelligence forward, outperforming traditional 
                            Graph Neural Network (GNN) pre-training methods and setting new benchmarks 
                            for performance. In this tutorial, we begin by offering a comprehensive 
                            review and analysis of existing methods that integrate LLMs with graphs. 
                            We introduce existing works based on a novel taxonomy that classifies 
                            them into three distinct categories according to the roles of LLMs in 
                            graph tasks: as enhancers, predictors, or alignment components. Secondly, 
                            we introduce a new learning method that utilizes prompting on graphs, 
                            offering substantial potential to enhance graph transfer capabilities 
                            across diverse tasks and domains. We discuss existing works on graph 
                            prompting within a unified framework and introduce our developed tool 
                            for executing a variety of graph prompting tasks. Additionally, we 
                            discuss the applications of combining Graphs, LLMs, and prompt learning 
                            across various tasks, such as urban computing, recommendation systems, and 
                            anomaly detection. <b>This lecture-style tutorial is an extension of
